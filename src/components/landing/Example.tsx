        {`I'm a full-stack developer by day and a technical writer by night.
I worked as a Software Developer at Matlabinfotech for 1 year and 9 months, where I gained experience in technologies like Nest.js, React.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Snowflake, DBT, and Jest. I also contributed to an exciting project, developing a Slack bot to automate workflows within the company.
During weekends, my fascination with Docker inspired me to build a remote code execution project, exploring containerization and secure execution environments.
Wanting to build an app end-to-end and explore Generative AI technologies, I created AspirantsAI. Using the Next.js framework, I handled everything from frontend and backend development to database management and deployment.
I write technical blogs to share insights, document learnings, and contribute to the developer community. Check my medium profile.
I am enthusiastic about remote work and collaborative opportunities worldwide, eager to contribute to impactful projects irrespective of geographical boundaries.`}

        <div>
          {`I am a pianist, and playing the piano is one of my greatest passions. It allows me to express emotions in a way that words often cannot. Beyond music, I have a deep love for exploring history. Delving into the past not only enriches my understanding of the world but also teaches me invaluable lessons. History reminds me that the world has come a long way and has become a better place over time. It fosters empathy within me, as understanding the struggles and triumphs of those who came before helps me connect with diverse perspectives.
I also enjoy watching good movies that leave a lasting impact. One movie that Iâ€™ve always loved and remember fondly is Schindler's List. The story of Oskar Schindler's courage and humanity during one of historyâ€™s darkest periods is both moving and inspiring.
When it comes to entertainment, my interests donâ€™t stop at history; I also have a strong appreciation for fiction and sci-fi. Some of my favorites include The Vampire Diaries, which captivated me with its intricate storytelling and compelling characters, as well as thought-provoking films like Interstellar and Source Code. These works fuel my imagination and make me marvel at the endless possibilities of storytelling and technology.
Music, history, and cinema all play a significant role in shaping who I am. They inspire me, challenge my perspective, and keep me connected to both the past and the future.
